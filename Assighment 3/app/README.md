## Essential Scripts

### `npm run build`

Generates a production-ready build in the `build` directory.\
his version is optimized, minified, and ready for deployment.

More on [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If default build tools or configurations don't meet your needs, use this command. It transfers all configurations and dependencies into your project for full control. However, post-ejection, there's no going back.
